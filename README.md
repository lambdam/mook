Hello,
I am discovering shadow-cljs for a personal project. I use Emacs. I'm used to figwheel way of working.
When there is a compilation error (for any reason), the completion in Emacs ceases to work. This makes coding quite painful. It's not the case in figwheel.
Will it change in future versions?
Thanks

can you open an issue on cider's github issue tracker with a minimal repro and I can attempt to find out what's going on?
